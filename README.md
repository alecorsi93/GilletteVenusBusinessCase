# Gillette Venus Business Case

Business case aimed at analyzing a dataset with the aim of increasing the penetration of the Gillette Venus brand during the seasonal peak (i.e. summer period) by highlighting potential stores and choosing the most suitable activities to promote in order to optimize sales in potential stores.

The first step was to complete the dataset since half of the output variable (i.e. ValueSales) was missing; the approach used was the following:
1) analysis of the correlation between the output variable and the other ones in order to find which ones could have a more "predictive power"  for ValueSales and, moreover, in order to avoid the multicollinearity phenomenon; 
2) implementation of a linear regression model in order to find the most  suitable (i.e. statistically significant) model to predict missing ValueSales.

The second step was to find the potential stores where to promote the most suitable activities for optimizing sales of Gillette Venus: the approach used was the following:
1) a criteria according to which a store would be considered as potential was chosen;
2) a classification tree was implemented in order to find the conditions for a store to be a potential one.

The last step was to choose the commercial strategy in order to optimize sales in potential stores: the idea was to strengthen the proximity to the sea of potential stores and the presence of campings in the surroundings (i.e places suitable for family holidays); another commercial strategy was based on the growing interest in eco-sustainability issues on product packaging.
